## YET ANOTHER WORM TRACKER

#### Because why not? 

This was written to process C. elegans chemotaxis behavior and follows a simple flow: if I know how many worms there are in an experiment (say, 8) then I should be able to start from a point where I can see all 8 worms and track outwards from that. This was written to see whether that is a better way of doing things.
